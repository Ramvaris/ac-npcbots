## Release notes

This PR removes the modelId column from creature table to allow us to move to a dual entry spawn system.

If this causes an issue for in game or custom spawns the following line of SAI can update the modelId.

(#entryorguid,0,0,0,11,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,#modelId,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Creature Name - On Spawn - Change Model to #modelId"),

Special thanks to @Shin @Kitzunu @M'Dic for assistance.
