Changelog for commit "[feature(Core/Spells): Allow to learn all spells for characters on creation](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk/commit/06ee4ea7c46a5c0494dd7502a7646e84f83dab89)"

### Added

- All abilities for classes up to TBC into playercreateinfo_spell_custom
- Config option PlayerStart.AllSpells - If enabled, players will start with all their class spells (not talents). You must populate playercreateinfo_spell_custom table with the spells you want, or this will not work! The table has data for all classes / races up to TBC expansion.

### Removed

- Config option PlayerStart.CustomSpells

### How to upgrade

- Update the worldserver.conf file with the new PlayerStart.AllSpells if you want to change it to "ON". Otherwise it will go with the default option "OFF" from the worldserver.conf.dist file.
