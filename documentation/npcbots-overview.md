# NPC Bots Overview (Placeholder)

This fork emphasizes NPC bot functionality enabling players to recruit or interact with autonomous characters simulating party members. Detailed bot subsystem code isn't summarized yet; this file will grow as analysis proceeds.

## Anticipated Components

- Bot Manager: Oversees creation, persistence, AI state machine.
- Command Extensions: Chat or gossip commands to summon/configure bots.
- AI Logic: Combat rotation, movement, positioning heuristics.
- Persistence: Storage of bot gear, talents, behavior flags in characters DB tables.

## Next Steps For Completion

1. Identify bot-related source directories / modules (search for "bot" / "npcbot").
2. Document class relationships and event hooks.
3. Summarize configuration flags controlling bot behavior.
