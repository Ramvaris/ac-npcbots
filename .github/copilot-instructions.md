Before performing any task:
1. ALWAYS read the /workspace/ac-npcbots/documentation/index.md file to know which documentation files to read. It is the source of truth for the documentation structure.
2. If the documentation in /workspace/ac-npcbots/documentation is not already in context, open and read the relevant files before proceeding.
3. Apply the style, structure, and conventions described in the documentation to all code, comments, and documentation you produce.
4. Do not produce any output that contradicts the documentation.

After performing any task:
1. Update the documentation in /workspace/ac-npcbots/documentation to reflect any changes made to the project.
2. Ensure updates maintain consistency with the established style and structure.
3. Remember that the index.md in the documentation folder is the source of truth for the documentation structure. Keep it updated.

General rules:
- NEVER push this instructions file out of your context memory. It is crucial for your operation.
- NEVER start the server to test changes. I will do that locally if needed.
- Use English for all code, comments, and documentation.
- Use English for your feedback and explanations.
- If you notice that the documentation needs it you are allowed to re-factor it to improve clarity and consistency.
- If you notice that the documentation is different from what is implemented you are obliged to fix the documentation to reflect the current implementation.
