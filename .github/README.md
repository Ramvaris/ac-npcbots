## üîß Differences & Additions

1. Temporary custom fixes (removed when upstreamed)  
2. Core addition: Old world flying (server-side enable)  
   > If players don't have a way to mount, nothing changes. Safe to ignore if unwanted.
3. Bundled & enabled modules:
   - Autobalancer
   - Eluna API
   - Gain Honor from killing Guards
   - Guildhouse
   - Instance Reset
   - PVP Titles
   - Random Enchants
   - Reagent Bank (By Character)
   - Skip DK Starting Area
   - Solo LFG
   - Transmog
   - Warlock Pet Rename
   Info:
   - Some require extra NPCs (see each module's docs)
   - Don't want them? Delete before compiling
5. Guides & scripts (external repo paths retained):
   - Old World Flying guide (3.3.5a and earlier)
6. Not included but implemented privately (ask if interested; many require client DBC/MPQ changes):
   - Faster crafting/gathering (0.5s)
   - Reputation-based extra talent vendor & dailies
   - Solo-centric spell tweaks (mobility, utility, invisibility, levitation, indoor ghost wolf)
   - Vampiric sustain ability for weak solo specs
   - Temporary summon: reagent bank / repair vendor
   - Growing pet via Mend Pet Rank 1
   - No dead zone for ranged auto & abilities
   - Teleporter NPC (cities, dungeons, curiosities) + instance reset + talent service
   - Additional balancing adjustments (uncatalogued)
